    <description><![CDATA[Overview In this post, I will explore some practical details in popular imitation learning from observation methods. Learning from observation (LfO) is the problem of learning a policy from a set of state-only expert demonstrations. The goal of LfO is to eventually enable agents to learn by observing humans or other robots. However, LfO is difficult because it both requires learning perception of what the expert is doing, and then learning a control policy on top of this learned perception.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[How well can we convert speech between people&rsquo;s voices? By: Andrew Szot, Arshdeep Singh, Md Nasir, Sriram Somasundaram
Introduction Recently, there have been many exciting results in computer vision with the introduction of deeper convolutional models that encode higher dimensional and interpretable features (neural style) [1]. In contrast, deep and thorough understanding of speech has suffered from the lack of deep learning models catering to audio signals. For a while, traditional audio processing techniques remained dominant over deep learning approaches in terms of audio classification and detection.]]></description>
